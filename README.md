# Data Exploration of YRBS 2023

## Overview  
This project explores data from the **Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 2023**.  
The YRBS is a survey that collects information about health-related behaviors among young people. These behaviors include mental health, substance use, physical activity, sexual health, and safety-related behaviors.

The goal of this project is to understand patterns and trends in the data using basic data exploration and visualization techniques.

- Clean and prepare the YRBS 2023 dataset  
- Explore key variables related to youth health behaviors  
- Identify common trends and patterns in the data  
- Visualize findings using simple charts and plots  
- Gain insights that can support public health research and decision-making
